Currently contains : 

## 1-1. Exercise on Budworms

Located in `budworms`.
A Python implementation of the budworm differential system from Session 1 Exercise Sheet, Exercise 1.
You can change the initial condition to view different solutions.

## 1-2. Exercise on Density-Dependent Prey-Predator model

Located in `densitydependence`.
A Python implementation of the density dependent prey predator model from Session 1 Exercise Sheet, Exercise 2.
You can change the initial condition or change some of the many parameters.

## 1-3. Exercise on Rosenzweig-McArthur model

Located in `mcarthur`.
A Python implementation of the Rosenzweig-McArthur model suggested in Session 1 Exercise Sheet, Exercise 3.
I don't fully know how this one works to be honest, try and change the initial condition but it seems to look good only for specific starting point. I included one that the professor chose in his code, but I have no idea how to find others.

## 1-4. Exercise on Food Chain

Located in `food_chain`.
A Python implementation of the food chain differential equations system from Session 1 Exercise Sheet, Exercise 4.
You can change the number of individuals, their starting conditions (in the list comprehension), and a few of the parameters. The exercise seems to want to change the value of `I`. I haven't done this but you can have fun with it. Rainbow colours and figure spacing are automatically taken care of.
